Along the way, you will perform numerous real-world tasks of a junior data analyst by following the steps of the data analysis proces\n\nTo answer this, I will perform an **exploratory data analysis** along with some data from 30 users 5 years ago.\n\n## Data Visualisation\n\nFor this project the focus will be on visualising the data.
